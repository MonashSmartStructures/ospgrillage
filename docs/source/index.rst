===========================================
OpenSeesPy Grillage wizard - *ospgrillage*
===========================================

*ospgrillage* is a python wrapper of the *OpenSeesPy* package to speed up the creation of bridge deck grillage models.
`OpenSeesPy <openseespydoc.readthedocs.io>`_ is a python interpreter of the well-know Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (`OpenSees <https://opensees.berkeley.edu/>`_) software framework.
*ospgrillage* provides a simple python API which allows users to:

1. Quickly generate and analyze a bridge deck grillage model in the *OpenSeesPy* model space, including many forms of loading and load cases;
2. Export a :code:`*.py` file containing the *OpenSeesPy* commands, which on execution, creates the prescribed *OpenSeesPy* grillage model.

The ability to use *ospgrillage* directly to do bridge deck analysis, or to export the *OpenSeesPy* command file for further editing, facilities an enormous range of use-cases in both bridge engineering practice and research.
